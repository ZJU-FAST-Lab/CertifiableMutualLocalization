classdef Feature < handle & matlab.mixin.Copyable
  %Plane Object with 3D feature
  %   See also Point, Line, Plane.

%   Technical:
%   This is a *handle* *copyable* object, that means that the object
%   created by the constructor is a handle (pointer) to the data.
%   If you want to get an *independent* copy of the object (clone)
%   use the method *copy* in the object.
%   Intuitively, the pose of an object is inherent to this
%   and should be assigned to a different object, but another object
%   could have the same value (copy).
%   See also handle, matlab.mixin.Copyable.
