% Checks the consistency of the cost function and the gradient.

% function checkgradient(problem)
% function checkgradient(problem, x)
% function checkgradient(problem, x, d)
%
% checkgradient performs a numerical test to check that the gradient
% defined in the problem structure agrees up to first order with the cost
% function at some point x, along some direction d. The test is based on a
% truncated Taylor series (see online Manopt documentation).
%
% It is also tested that the gradient is indeed a tangent vector.
% 
% Both x and d are optional and will be sampled at random if omitted.
