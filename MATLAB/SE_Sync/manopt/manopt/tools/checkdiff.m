function checkdiff(problem, x, d)
% Checks the consistency of the cost function and directional derivatives.

% function checkdiff(problem)
% function checkdiff(problem, x)
% function checkdiff(problem, x, d)
%
% checkdiff performs a numerical test to check that the directional
% derivatives defined in the problem structure agree up to first order with
% the cost function at some point x, along some direction d. The test is
% based on a truncated Taylor series (see online Manopt documentation).
%
% Both x and d are optional and will be sampled at random if omitted.
