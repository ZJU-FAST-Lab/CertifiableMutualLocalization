%
% checkhessian performs a numerical test to check that the directional
% derivatives and Hessian defined in the problem structure agree up to
% second order with the cost function at some point x, along some direction
% d. The test is based on a truncated Taylor series (see online Manopt
% documentation).
% 
% It is also tested that the result of applying the Hessian along that
% direction is indeed a tangent vector, and that the Hessian operator is
% symmetric w.r.t. the Riemannian metric.
% 
% Both x and d are optional and will be sampled at random if omitted.
